# Overview
Hello all, this regression project is build using Random Forest Regressor. </br>
Model is train using HyperParameter Tuning</br>
The reason behind selecting Random Forest is it works well with all kind of data(imbalanced data etc). and with Hyperparameter Tuning it gives better performance

# Part-1
First we perform EDA on given data. Handling all missing values, Performing OneHot encoding and extracting only required features.</br>
Here all date and time columns are converted into numerical values
